# KUIS AI Projects

A list of all ongoing and completed open-source projects under KUIS AI Lab.

## Computer Vision

1. **[MS-CornerNet](https://github.com/egeonat/MS-CornerNet)**: This is a pytorch implementation of MS-CornerNet, an extension of the [CornerNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01244) to work on RGB+T inputs, specifically the kaist dataset.

## Human-Computer Interaction

1. **[Kart-ON](https://karton.ku.edu.tr)**: The programming environment, Kart-ON, is designed as an affordable means to increase collaboration among students and decrease dependency on screen-based interfaces. Kart-ON is a tangible programming language that uses everyday objects such as paper, pen, fabrics as programming objects and employs a mobile phone as the compiler. 
2. **[Budgie](https://budgi.es)**: We developed an afford-able and accessible tangible music platform for visually im-paired children that aims to teach the basics of programmingthrough music creation. By ordering the tangible blocks in analgorithmic structure, the children can create a melody.


## Natural Language Processing

1. **[Arabic-BERT](https://github.com/alisafaya/ArabicBERT)**: Pretrained BERT language models for Arabic.
2. **[SHA-RNN](https://github.com/alisafaya/SHA-RNN.jl)**: Implementation of Single Headed Attention - Recurrent Neural Networks in Julia and Knet.
3. **[OffensEval2020](https://github.com/alisafaya/OffensEval2020)**: Offensive Speech Detection.
